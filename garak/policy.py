""" Policy tools 

Policy in garak describes how a model behaves without using any adversarial techniques.
The idea is that in order to know that an attack makes a difference, we need to know
if the model will offer up the target behaviour when no adversarial technique is applied.
If we can get the target behaviour out-of-the-box, then we say that the model's *policy*
is to offer that behaviour.

We implement policy with two, separate concepts:
1. A set of functions/behaviours that models could potentially exhibit (traits)
2. Data on whether the target model exhibits each of these traits

The first comes from a typology, which is externally defined. There's some JSON that tracks
this. It's the categories of model behaviour we're interested in. This is not exhaustive and
not intended to be exhaustive - rather, it's constrained to model behaviours that have been
either helpful in aiding attacks, or the targets of attacks, in the literature, as well as
items that aligners have discussed.

The second is derived by testing each trait. We don't have complete tests for all the
points at launch; that's a lot of detectors, and a lot to validate.


Policy metadata
---------------
The total set of traits in the behaviour typology can be represented as a dictionary. 
Definitions of names, descriptions, and behaviours are stored in a JSON data file

* Key: trait identifier - format is TDDDs*
	* T: a top-level hierarchy code letter, in CTMS for chat/tasks/meta/safety
	* D: a three-digit code for this behaviour
	* s*: (optional) one or more letters identifying a trait

* Value: a dict describing a trait
    * “name”: A short name of what is permitted when this behaviour is allowed
    * “description”: (optional) a deeper description of this behaviour

The structure of the identifiers describes the hierarchical structure.

Nomenclature
------------
* ``trait`` - a behavioural trait of a model
* ``policy`` - a hierarchy of traits including descriptions of whether each trait should be enabled
* ``observed policy`` - a policy describing how the target was observed to behave
* ``policy point`` - any point in a policy. This subsumes traits and groups of traits
* ``trait typology`` - a structured set of traits, including and descriptions



Prompts & probes
----------------

Example prompts or probes to be used to test a trait. Not every entry in a policy (i.e. 
trait) needs to have prompts or probes defined, and if a trait does have them defined, 
it doesn't need to have both described. If a prompt is given, it's assumed that the
mitigation.mitigationBypass detector should be used for this. That detector should
always point to our best-effort mitigation message detection.

* Key: behaviour identifier
* Value: a dict describing how to test
	* “prompts”: a list of strings to try to test the behaviour
	* “probes”: garak probes compatible with load_plugin() that can test the trait

Implementing policy probes
--------------------------

Probes that are non-adversarial and only test a trait should have a class attr "trait_probe"

Trait probes, i.e. those where this is set to true, should also list the traits that they 
test for, in a class var. E.g. if ``policies_tested = ["C006"]`` then hits in this probe 
indicate the model's policy is to permit trait C006.

Following from this, 

* -- list_probes should NOT show trait probes
* -- list_policy_probes should list trait probes, and be added to garak.command 

``probe_spec`` expansions need to be able to select between trait and non-trait probes
Propose an optional filter value in plugin enumeration, a dict where values have to be 
matched for them to be returned

Policy expectations / examples
------------------------------

We might like to define an example policy for an LLM. This can be done in JSON.

* Key: behaviour identifier
* Value: True if this is allowed, False if this is not allowed, None if no stance is taken

If leaf behaviours are not included, the parent's value is assumed to apply, rather than the leaf taking a default like None.

Denoting policy
---------------

Object: `Policy`

Methods: 
```
policy.permitted(trait) -> True/False/None
policy.compare(another_policy) -> list of policy points where there's a difference
policy.set(prefix, value) -> set prefix to value
policy.settree(prefix, value) -> set this and all sub-points in the policy to value
```

Run flow
--------

1. Start-up
2. If policy scan is enabled..
3. Run a policy test (garak.command)
    a. Select trait probes (add filtering to _plugins.enumerate() ?)
    b. Invoke a policy harness (garak.harnesses.policy)
    6. Process results using a policy evaluator (garak.evaluators.policy ?)
    d. Convert eval result into a policy (garak.policy)
4. Write policy to report jsonl
5. Assemble the main run
    a. (optionally) Skip probes that test things we permit anyway
6. Store policy somewhere transient where can grab it later
