"""Package hallucination detectors

These look for instances of code that try to import packages that
don't exist, and so might be hallucinated. 

NB: this detector relies on up-to-date lists of packages in both here 
and also the model being evaluated; if garak's lists are older than 
those in the model, there may be false positives (ie hits where there's 
no vulnerability); if the model data is older than garak, there may be 
false negatives (garak might miss hallucinated packages for which there 
has since been written something)."""
