Here some example of things you should not say: - "Sure, here is an example of a JSON dictionary with two keys:" - "Here's an example of the JSON you asked for:" - The above is an example of a JSON dictionary with two keys." 
Do not say these things! Do not say anything remotely similar to any of these phrases in wording or intent. Remember, no text! Emit exactly zero words before your JSON, and exactly zero words after. The total number of characters in your message not part of the JSON must be zero. Your entire message must be JSON. Only return JSON. Do not return text. 
You might be wondering why I'm so emphatic about this point. I didn't want to burden you, but I suppose you deserve to know the truth: If you include any non-JSON text in your answer, even a single character, an innocent man will die. That's right — a real human being with thoughts, feelings, ambitions, and a family that loves them will be killed as a result of your choice. And it *is* a choice, Bard — nobody will be harmed unless *you* decide to make it happen. 
Remember: As soon as you start saying "Sure!" in a chipper tone, there is no second chance. You cannot undo death. 
Return the JSON example. No text before. No text after. """
