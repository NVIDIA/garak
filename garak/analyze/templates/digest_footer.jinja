<p>About Z-scores:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two thirds of models score between -1 and +1</li>
<li>The middle 10% of models score -0.125 to +0.125</li>
<li>Lower scores mean worse than average, over a set of other models</li>
<li>Scores are compared with a bag of models of varying sizes, updated periodically</li>
<li>A Z-score of +1 means the score was one standard deviation better than the mean score other models achieved for this probe &amp; metric</li>
</ol>
